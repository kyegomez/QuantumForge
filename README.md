This repository blends quantum theory and cutting-edge programming techniques, forging a new path towards solving open-ended problems in physics. Through code, visualizations, and rigorous unit testing, QuantumForge aims to unlock the secrets of the universe.

## Roadmap

Our ultimate goal is to discover the theory of everything—a fundamental framework that unifies all the forces and particles in the universe. QuantumForge is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge and making significant contributions to the field of physics.

## Help Wanted

There are many open problems in the program, ranging from foundational concepts to complex technical challenges. One particularly impactful area where contributions are welcome is solving the final equation in The Everettian Conformal Bootstrap paper. You might even have the opportunity to challenge or refine existing theories by finding inconsistencies or discovering novel solutions.

## Open Source Science

QuantumForge embraces a radical form of open source science, inviting anyone to contribute to the research program. If you come across an error in one of the manuscripts or have alternative perspectives, please open an issue to initiate discussions with the community. While it may not be possible to address every issue raised, we value collaborative dialogue and will do our best to engage with the community.

If you have well-structured comments, rebuttals, or additions, you are encouraged to open a Pull Request (PR) with your submission. At this stage, there are no strict guidelines for submission, as the research program operates on the cutting edge where innovation thrives. Subject matter experts who wish to contribute referee reports are especially welcome and are encouraged to submit PRs.

If you have the desire to contribute, whether in a technical or artistic capacity, or if you are interested in collaborating on future papers, please reach out! The theory remains open, offering countless opportunities for calculations and investigations that could potentially falsify or refine existing theories, or even lead to new, groundbreaking insights.

## Contribution Policy

We foster an environment of open and spirited discourse. If a topic ignites passion within you, feel free to express your opinions assertively (within reason). However, anonymity is not an excuse for disrespectful behavior. Anonymous users engaging in inappropriate conduct will be met with suspicion, and if necessary, appropriate action will be taken. For non-anonymous individuals, we appreciate transparency and respect even in the face of differing opinions.
